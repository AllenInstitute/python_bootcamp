    "\n",
    "<p>Scikit-learn, also known as sklearn, is a popular and widely-used open-source machine learning library in Python. This library provides a robust set of tools for various machine learning tasks, including supervised and unsupervised learning which are a central focus of this tutorial. Scikit-learn is built on top of other scientific computing libraries like NumPy and SciPy, making it a powerful and efficient choice for data scientists and machine learning practitioners.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The primary goal of scikit-learn is to simplify the process of applying machine learning algorithms to real-world data. It offers a user-friendly interface for working with data, creating machine learning models, and evaluating their performance. The library supports a broad range of algorithms, from traditional statistical methods to cutting-edge machine learning techniques, making it suitable for both beginners and experienced researchers.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The purpose of this tutorial is to provide a high-level overview of supervised and unsupervised learning and describe how to utilize scikit-learn to build machine learning models tailored for these specific tasks. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a solid understanding of the key concepts, methods, and techniques required to effectively leverage scikit-learn for creating powerful and accurate machine learning models in both supervised and unsupervised settings. \n",

    "<h2>Supervised Learning</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Supervised learning is a machine learning approach where an algorithm learns from labeled training data to make accurate predictions or decisions. In this setting, a dataset consists of input-output pairs, where each input is associated with a corresponding desired output. The goal is to learn a model (or function) that maps inputs to outputs (or targets) from the training set so that the model can then accurately predict outputs for new, unseen inputs.\n",
    "\n",

    "1. **Inputs**\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we are given a set of _inputs_ which we denote as $X=\\{x^{(1)},\\ldots, x^{(n)}\\}$. An input $x^{(i)}$ is a vector where each entry is a feature that describes that data point. Using the housing price prediction example, some relevant features for a house are the number of bedrooms and square footage. If we have a new house with 4 bedrooms and 2500 square footage, then the feature vector for this house is $x^{(i)}=$ (4, 2500).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Targets**\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we are given a set of _targets_ denoted as $y=\\{y^{(1)},\\ldots, y^{(n)}\\}$ such that each target $y^{(i)}$ is the value that the model is trying to predict or estimate based on the input $x^{(i)}$. Targets represent the values we are aiming to understand, predict, or classify using the trained machine learning model. Using the housing price prediction example, the label would be the actual price of the house corresponding to the input data. For example, suppose that our new house with 3 bedrooms and 1800 square footage is sold for $\\$$500,000, then the target would be $y^{(i)}=500,000$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, our objective is to train a _model_ on a dataset that contains examples of inputs along with corresponding desired label. The model learns from these examples by identifying underlying relationships and adjusting its internal parameters to optimize its performance. In this example, our goal is to learn some function $f$ such that $f(x^{(i)})\\approx y^{(i)}$, then use this function to predict the value of a house that is about to be listed. \n",
