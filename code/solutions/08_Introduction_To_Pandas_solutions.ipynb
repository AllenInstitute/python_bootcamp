    "After examining your dataframe you may find that there are certain columns whose data types do not match your assumptions or whose data types could inhibit analysis. For example, if you have a column that contains numbers, but the data type is string- you would not actually be able to do numeric operations on it. You can cast the data to a different datatype using  **[.astype()](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.astype.html)**. \n",
